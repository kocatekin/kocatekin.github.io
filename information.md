# Regarding summer school

- The school will publish a list of courses offered during the summer session. Be sure to check this official publication for your options.
- You are permitted to enroll in a maximum of three (3) courses during the summer school period.
- If a course you wish to take is not offered by your school, you may be able to take it at another institution.

## External Course Approval Process

- To enroll in an external course, you must obtain and complete a specific form from the Student Affairs office.
- It is **mandatory** to submit the syllabus of the external course along with your form. This is crucial for evaluation.
- The external course's curriculum and AKTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) credits must be equivalent to a similar course offered by your school. This equivalency will be assessed based on the syllabus you provide.
