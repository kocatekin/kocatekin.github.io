      <hr>
      <li><b>Exam Generator:</b> Task is first to create a very basic DSL. Later, the application will parse the text file and generate a LaTeX document using the exam module.</li>
      <li><b>Static Site Generator:</b> Task is to create a static web page based on a given directory and subdirectories. Posts will be in Markdown. Theme capability would be good.</li>
      <li><b>Web Application:</b> Task is to create a zettelkasten-like (or eksi sozluk like) clone, where you can have multiple versions for your own use. It does not have to have a messaging facility. A user is going to be able to create multiple versions for herself and they will be separate. A CRUD app.</li>
      <li><b>Quiz Builder:</b> Task is to create a web app to be used on web & mobile. There will be an admin panel, admin is able to create quizzes (can use an external text file) there. Students will have a username and password, they will be able to solve questions within a designated time limit and automatically graded by the application.</li>
