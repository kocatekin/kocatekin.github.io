      <h1>Topics for Graduation Thesis</h1>
      <p>Please remember that you are to write a good report on these software. In almost all of them, you are going to show other examples and detailed information about the technologies you've learned and use. It is not just a software project, there is also research.</p>
      <p>I want everyone to have a version control system in place, preferably Git.</p>

      <li><b>Exam Generator:</b> Task is first to create a very basic DSL. Later, the application will parse the text file and generate a LaTeX document using the exam module.</li>
      <li><b>Static Site Generator:</b> Task is to create a static web page based on a given directory and subdirectories. Posts will be in Markdown. Theme capability would be good.</li>
      <!-- <li><b>A Web Application:</b> Task is to create a zettelkasten-like (or eksi sozluk like) clone, where you can have multiple versions for your own use. It does not have to have a messaging facility. A user is going to be able to create multiple versions for herself and they will be separate. A CRUD app.</li> -->
      <!-- <li><b>Quiz Builder:</b> Task is to create a web app to be used on web & mobile. There will be an admin panel, admin is able to create quizzes (can use an external text file) there. Students will have a username and password, they will be able to solve questions within a designated time limit and automatically graded by the application.</li> -->
      <li><b>Password Manager:</b> Task is to create a password manager. It will store passwords in encrypted form, the key is going to be derived from the master password. User is expected to learn about password storage, encryption, key derivation functions, etc. A GUI application would be better.</li>
      <!-- <li><b>Presentation Program:</b> There is a program called Suckless Sent. By the same philosophy, try to build a very simple presentation program in GUI version. It is going to be a minimalistic presentation framework, also the presentations will be minimal. Should have markdown support. It must be a GUI application.</li> -->
      <!-- <li><b>SPA(Single Page App)</b>: In an area you are interested, you can create a multi-platform SPA. It should have gamification built-in. For example, let's say you are interested in mechanical watches. The system is going to give information about mechanical watches. It should be fully responsive, a very good example of a good front-end design. It should also include gamification, where the user is going to do a quiz after reading the part.</li> -->

      <h2>NOTES</h2>
      <p>You are free to propose projects, but keep in mind it is possible for me to reject them. I will not accept too easy projects which can be done in a week. It should not be entirely composed of a single library.</p>
      <p>Projects should be a product. It should just work when I run them, and you should be able to answer any question about the topic and the code you've written. So, even if you are building a data app, I will not accept if you are playing with the code from the Jupyter notebook, it should be adjustable in the UI.</p>
      <p>Whatever the project is, I also want a thorough thesis.</p>
